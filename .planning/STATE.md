## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Web Worker required from day 1 (retrofitting later is expensive)
- Coordinate convention: convert OSM lat/lon to GeoJSON lon/lat at parse boundary
- Distance-weighted A* (not time-weighted) to keep haversine heuristic admissible
- Snap to road segment (not just nearest node) for MAP-01/02/ROUT-01

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
